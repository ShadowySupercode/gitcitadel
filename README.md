# GitCitadel project repo

Welcome to the abstract repo for our GitCitadel project. This is the repo we're using to communicate about our project team and products.

All issues and bug reports for any product should be submitted to our [GitWorkshop page](https://gitworkshop.dev/repo/gitcitadel). We will handle first-level support there. Please make sure to mention which product you are having the issue with, so that we can channel it to the appropriate product team. 
(Thank you, [DanConway](https://njump.me/nprofile1qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qghwaehxw309aex2mrp0yhxummnw3ezucnpdejz7qgwwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkctcqyzsq3hh327t0h2dq6matqn5064cgj2zanl2stkj6s0lg4t2h5dty6ek49a0), for hosting us!).

## About Us

We're a team of IT professionals, STEM students, and amateur techies, united by two things:
1) We adhere to the "git ethos" of distributed or decentralized freedom-tech for all.
2) We are all seeking to build our own personal citadels, where everyone is free to express themselves and live according to their own principles, so long as they do not infringe upon the Natural Rights of others.

We originally began working alone, each for her/himself, but we quickly realized how inefficient this atomization was, so we've moved to a decentralized model, where different topics are handled in different repos by different teams. Some development will even be handled in external repos and merely integrated during the build process.

Tying ourselves together in this "development cooperative" allows us quite a bit of independence, at the same time as we can leverage the skills, knowledge, and income of the entire group, to compete at the same level as more corporate offerings.

## Project Team

The development teams for individual products will be listed in the ReadMe of those products, but here are the culprits at the project level, who are responsible for the mess you see before you.

| **Team Member** | **Role** | **Description**   |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| [Buttercat](https://njump.me/nprofile1qydhwumn8ghj7argv4nx7un9wd6zumn0wd68yvfwvdhk6tcpz4mhxue69uhkummnw3ezummcw3ezuer9wchszrnhwden5te0dehhxtnvdakz7qpqwqfzz2p880wq0tumuae9lfwyhs8uz35xd0kr34zrvrwyh3kvrzusj0rq2x) <br>Also known as "MichaelJ". | Product Owner | This is where the buck stops. No features are built or libraries are included, until he gives the say-so. |
| [Silberwitch](https://njump.me/nprofile1qydhwumn8ghj7argv4nx7un9wd6zumn0wd68yvfwvdhk6tcprpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezuum0we3xjapwdphhxap0qqs06gywary09qmcp2249ztwfq3ue8wxhl2yyp3c39thzp55plvj0sg5wkcew) <br>Also known as "Laeserin".| Business Analyst | This is the teams's Girl Friday, doing all of the daily tasks that would otherwise fall under the table, while the guys are off grinding. Marketing, coordination and recruitment, design and documentation, 1st level support, and system testing... our all-rounder. |
| [Finrod](https://njump.me/nprofile1qyvhwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnndehhyapwwdhkx6tpdshsz9thwden5te0dehhxarj9ehhsarj9ejx2a30qqsvuxle4kfpvn0jy7lu4v5pxxfuvr45qgwnt06th0r05fx9vrg086gxvf84f) <br>Also known as "Finrod". | Development Operations | No product shall pass, until his build server stamps it DONE. He keeps the machines running, the automated tests green, and the developers bug-fixing. |

## Products

Here is a table listing all of the project's product repositories and which external libraries they utilize or have used as a reference.

(Please note that we have turned off "issues" in the GitHub settings of our project's repos, as we are a Nostr-forward project team and will be handling our issues there.)
