# GitCitadel project repo

Welcome to the abstract repo for our GitCitadel project. This is the repo we're using to communicate about our project team and products.

All issues and bug reports for any product should be submitted to our [GitWorkshop page](https://gitworkshop.dev/r/naddr1qq9xw6t5vd5hgctyv4kqz9nhwden5te0wfjkccte9ehx7um5wghxyctwvspzplfq3m5v3u5r0q9f255fdeyz8nyac6lagssx8zy4wugxjs8ajf7pqvzqqqrhnycza0vr/). We will handle first-level support there. Please make sure to mention which product you are having the issue with, so that we can channel it to the appropriate product team.
