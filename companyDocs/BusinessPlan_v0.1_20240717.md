## Offer and Value Proposition

| *Product* | *Description* | *Value Proposition* |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| TheCitadel and TheForest Relays (in production) | TheForest is a general-purpose Nostr relay, with a manually-curated user list, where most of the events are "short message", "comment/reply" or "microblogging" notes. TheCitadel is a publicly-available relay specializing in the storage of documents, such as git commit notes, articles and wiki pages. | These relays function as the "defaults" for our products, so that we can ensure a positive first impression users have of the clients. These also function as potential locations for private groups and custom communities. |
| GitCitadel Online (in production) | Website and remote server. Includes Jenkins build server, Gitea code server, and various Nostr-based applications, including web applications and tools from GitCitadel. | This server is essential to our own internal processes, but also serves as an online entrypoint and showcase for our products. |
| Aedile NDK (in development) | Nostr software development kit, featuring the NoScrypt library. | This NDK is written in the language closest to the hardware (C/C++) and is designed to be especially stable, efficient, and secure. With this NDK, we can offer professional-grade quality libraries upon which we build our products. We can also offer the NDK (and any associated tools), directly to developers. |
| GC-Alexandria (in development) | Nostr Knowledge Base (NKB) and eReading web app. Previously titled "indextr" and the first client to utilize Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIP) specifications NKBIP-01 and NKBIP-02. This client will have a HTTP-based option, to allow for usage on ePaper. | Alexandria is the first true literature and documentation viewer and navigator for Nostr events. It will allow for smart analysis and perusal of Nostr article events, and implements the novel "modular article" event type. Alexandria breaks documents down into their disparate parts, so that each part can be combined, remixed, linked to, described, labeled, tracked and duplicated in isolation, or as collections of events. |
| GitRepublic (in planning) | Nostr and Ngit-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for desktop, utilizing Aedile NDK and Ngit command line interface, and AI-driven code proposals. | This product will be the first attempt to create a tool that all developers and software team members (such as testers, analysts, designers, document writers) -- but especially those working on the cutting-edge Nostr protocol -- can use emersively, as a sort of software project dashboard. |

## Audience and Ideal Customer

Our product line is aimed at:
* readers and writers of books, articles, and magazines
* scientists, engineers, and other academics
* software development project team members

Since education (both formal and autodidactic), creative activities, and the search for knowledge tends to be associated with above-average income potential, we are aiming our Nostr-based products at customers more likely to be in a position to pay for software and services.

We expect some of our customers will be registered companies, universities, self-publishers and the otherwise self-employed, or startup teams, so we are concentrating on delivering the level of quality expected in the business-to-business market.

We have explicitly excluded clients that merely reproduce "the social media experience", or similar, as that is already a saturated, highly-competitive field, where the market requires high numbers of users, extremely-rapid software releases, and excessive branding, in order to break even.

## Revenue Streams

### Donations, crowdfunding, and grants
as an open-source software provider, we will tend to collect a significant amount of revenue over voluntary and foundation/insitutional contributions

### Software licensing and memberships
craft special features and/or services for premium customers and patrons.

### Social media income
continue to receive revenue over the GitCitadel lightning wallet directly, and indirectly over the wallets of our members. (There is no clear rule for the pass-through of funds from member wallets. This is a voluntary act.)

### E-book sales

### Video, webinar, and podcast income
monetize channels and tutorials related to our product line and the Nostr environment, among others.
