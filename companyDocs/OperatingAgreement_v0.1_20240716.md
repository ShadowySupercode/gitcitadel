In addition, the LLC may advance costs of defense of any proceeding to the Member or any such officer, agent, or employee upon receipt by the LLC of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the LLC.
