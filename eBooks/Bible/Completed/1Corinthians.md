# The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians

## 1 Corinthians Introduction
St. Paul, having planted the faithful in Corinth, where he had preached a year and a half and converted a great many, went to Ephesus. After being there three years, he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians and sent it by the same persons, Stephanus, Fortunatus and Achaicus, who had brought their letter to him. It was written about twenty-four years after our Lord’s Ascension and contains several matters appertaining to faith and morals and also to ecclesiastical discipline.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:Introduction
He reproveth their dissensions about their teachers. The world was to be saved by preaching of the cross, and not by human wisdom or eloquence.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:1
Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:2
To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:3
Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:4
I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:5
That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance and in all knowledge;  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:6
As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:7
So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:8
Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:9
God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:10
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you: but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:11
For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:12
Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:13
Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:14
I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:15
Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:16
And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:17
For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:18
For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:19
For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:20
Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:21
For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:22
For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:23
But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:24
But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:25
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  The foolishness, etc.... That is to say, what appears foolish to the world in the ways of God, is indeed most wise; and what appears weak is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:26
For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:27
But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:28
And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:29
That no flesh should glory in his sight.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:30
But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:31
That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:Introduction
His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:1
And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:2
For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:3
And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:4
And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:5
That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:6
Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:7
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:8
Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:9
But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:10
But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:11
For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:12
Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:13
Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:14
But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.  The sensual man—the spiritual man.... The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:15
But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 2:16
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 3

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:Introduction
They must not contend about their teachers, who are but God’s ministers and accountable to him. Their works shall be tried by fire.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:1
And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:2
I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:3
For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:4
For while one saith: I indeed am of Paul: and another: I am of Apollo: are you not men? What then is Apollo and what is Paul?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:5
The ministers of him whom you have believed: and to every one as the Lord hath given.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:6
I have planted, Apollo watered: but God gave the increase.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:7
Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:8
Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:9
For we are God’s coadjutors. You are God’s husbandry: you are God’s building.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:10
According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:11
For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:12
Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:  Upon this foundation.... The foundation is Christ and his doctrine: or the true faith in him, working through charity. The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser sins. Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial, (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest of what sort every man’s work has been: of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of God’s judgment shall try every man’s work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:13
Every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:14
If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:15
If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:16
Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:17
But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:18
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:19
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:20
And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:21
Let no man therefore glory in men.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:22
For all things are yours, whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 3:23
And you are Christ’s. And Christ is God’s.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 4

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:Introduction
God’s ministers are not to be judged. He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:1
Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:2
Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:3
But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man’s day. But neither do I judge my own self.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:4
For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:5
Therefore, judge not before the time: until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise from God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:6
But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:7
For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:8
You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:9
For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:10
We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honourable, but we without honour.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:11
Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:12
And we labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled: and we bless. We are persecuted: and we suffer it.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:13
We are blasphemed: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:14
I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest children.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:15
For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:16
Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:17
For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus: as I teach every where in every church.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:18
As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:19
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:20
For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 4:21
What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit of meekness?   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:Introduction
He excommunicates the incestuous adulterer and admonishes them to purge out the old leaven.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:1
It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father’s wife.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:2
And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:3
I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:4
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:5
To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:6
Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:7
Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:8
Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:9
I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:10
I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this world.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:11
But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:12
For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 5:13
For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:Introduction
He blames them for going to law before unbelievers. Of sins that exclude from the kingdom of heaven. The evil of fornication.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:1
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:2
Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:3
Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:4
If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:5
I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:6
But brother goeth to law with brother: and that before unbelievers.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:7
Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  A fault.... Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:8
But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:9
Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:10
Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:11
And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:12
All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any.  All things are lawful, etc.... That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:13
Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:14
Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:15
Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:16
Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:17
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:18
Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:19
Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God: and you are not your own?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 6:20
For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 7

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:Introduction
Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy. Virginity is preferable to a married state.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:1
Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:2
But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband.  Have his own wife.... That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are. (Ver. 7:8.) But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:3
Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:4
The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:5
Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:6
But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.  By indulgence.... That is, by a condescension to your weakness.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:7
For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:8
But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:9
But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.  If they do not contain, etc.... This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by vow, have given their first faith to God; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, if they cannot contain.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:10
But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:11
And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:12
For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away.  I speak, not the Lord.... Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:13
And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:14
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy.  Is sanctified.... The meaning is not, that the faith of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation; but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:15
But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:16
For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:17
But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:18
Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:19
Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:20
Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:21
Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:22
For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:23
You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:24
Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:25
Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:26
I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:27
Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:28
But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:29
This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:30
And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:31
And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:32
But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:33
But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:34
And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:35
And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:36
But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry.  Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc.... The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will and not sin, provided they afterwards marry; but that the father, with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no sin to him if she marry.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:37
For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:38
Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:39
A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 7:40
But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:Introduction
Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:1
Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth.  Knowledge puffeth up, etc.... Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:2
And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:3
But if any man love God, the same is known by him.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:4
But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:5
For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many):  Gods many, etc.... Reputed for such among the heathens.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:6
Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:7
But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:8
But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:9
But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:10
For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:11
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:12
Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 8:13
Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.  If meat scandalize.... That is, if my eating cause my brother to sin.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 9

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:Introduction
The apostle did not make use of his power of being maintained at the charges of those to whom he preached, that he might give no hindrance to the gospel. Of running in the race and striving for the mastery.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:1
Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:2
And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:3
My defence with them that do examine me is this.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:4
Have not we power to eat and to drink?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:5
Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister as well as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas?  A woman, a sister.... Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:6
Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:7
Who serveth as a soldier, at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:8
Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say; these things?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:9
For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:10
Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:11
If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:12
If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:13
Know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar partake with the altar?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:14
So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:15
But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die rather than that any man should make my glory void.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:16
For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me: for a necessity lieth upon me. For woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.  It is no glory.... That is, I have nothing to glory of.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:17
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:18
What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:19
For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:20
And I became to the Jews a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:21
To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:22
To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:23
And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be made partaker thereof.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:24
Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:25
And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things. And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible one.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:26
I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 9:27
But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway.  I chastise, etc.... Here St. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:Introduction
By the example of the Israelites, he shews that we are not to build too much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the service of idols and from things offered to idols.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:1
For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud: and all passed through the sea.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:2
And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea:  In Moses.... Under the conduct of Moses, they received baptism in figure, by passing under the cloud, and through the sea; and they partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure, by eating of the manna, (called here a spiritual food because it was a figure of the true bread which comes down from heaven,) and drinking the water, miraculously brought out of the rock, called here a spiritual rock, because it was also a figure of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:3
And did all eat the same spiritual food:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:4
And all drank the same spiritual drink: (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.)  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:5
But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:6
Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things, as they also coveted.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:7
Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:8
Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication: and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:9
Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:10
Neither do you murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:11
Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.  The ends of the world.... That is, the last ages.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:12
Wherefore, he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:13
Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.  Or.... no temptation hath taken hold of you.... or come upon you as yet, but what is human, or incident to man. Issue.... or a way to escape.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:14
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:15
I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:16
The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord?  Which we bless.... Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, ver. 21, that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils by eating of the meats sacrificed to them.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:17
For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread.  One bread.... or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread. For it is by our communicating with Christ, and with one another, in this blessed sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:18
Behold Israel according to the flesh. Are not they that eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:19
What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? Or that the idol is any thing?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:20
But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:21
You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:22
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me: but all things are not expedient.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:23
All things are lawful for me: but all things do not edify.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:24
Let no man seek his own, but that which is another’s.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:25
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat: asking no question for conscience’ sake.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:26
The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:27
If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you be willing to go: eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:28
But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols: do not eat of it, for his sake that told it and for conscience’ sake.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:29
Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:30
If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:31
Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:32
Be without offence to the Jew, and to the Gentiles and to the church of God:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 10:33
As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself but to many: that they may be saved.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 11

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:Introduction
Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:1
Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:2
Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:3
But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:4
Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:5
But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:6
For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:7
The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:8
For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:9
For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:10
Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.  A power.... that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:11
But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:12
For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:13
You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:14
Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:15
But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:16
But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:17
Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:18
For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:19
For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you.  There must be also heresies.... By reason of the pride and perversity of man’s heart; not by God’s will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:20
When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper.  The Lord’s supper.... So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:21
For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:22
What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:23
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:24
And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:25
In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:26
For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:27
Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.  Or drink.... Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink.  Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc.... This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord’s body.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:28
But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice.  Drink of the chalice.... This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:29
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:30
Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:31
But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:32
But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:33
Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 11:34
If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:Introduction
Of the diversity of spiritual gifts. The members of the mystical body, like those of the natural body, must mutually cherish one another.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:1
Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:2
You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:3
Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:4
Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:5
And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:6
And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:7
And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:8
To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:9
To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:10
To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of speeches.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:11
But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:12
For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:13
For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:14
For the body also is not one member, but many.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:15
If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:16
And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:17
If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:18
But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:19
And if they all were one member, where would be the body?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:20
But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:21
And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:22
Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are more necessary.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:23
And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:24
But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:25
That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually careful one for another.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:26
And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:27
Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:28
And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:29
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:30
Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 12:31
But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:Introduction
Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:1
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:2
And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:3
And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:4
Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:5
Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:6
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:7
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:8
Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:9
For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:10
But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:11
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:12
We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:13
And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:Introduction
The gift of prophesying is to be preferred before that of speaking strange tongues.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:1
Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.  Prophesy.... That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:2
For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.  Not unto men.... Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:3
But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:4
He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:5
And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:6
But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:7
Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:8
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:9
So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:10
There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:11
If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:12
So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.  Of spirits.... Of spiritual gifts.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:13
And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:14
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without fruit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:15
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:16
Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou sayest.  Amen.... The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:17
For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:18
I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:19
But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:20
Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and in sense be perfect.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:21
In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:22
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:23
If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:24
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:25
The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:26
How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:27
If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:28
But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:29
And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:30
But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:31
For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:32
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:33
For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:34
Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:35
But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:36
Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:37
If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:38
But if any man know not, he shall not be known.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:39
Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with tongues.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 14:40
But let all things be done decently and according to order.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:Introduction
Christ’s resurrection and ours. The manner of our resurrection.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:1
Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:2
By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:3
For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:4
And that he was buried: and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:5
And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:6
Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:7
After that, he was seen by James: then by all the apostles.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:8
And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:9
For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:10
But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me hath not been void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:11
For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have believed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:12
Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:13
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:14
And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith is also vain.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:15
Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:16
For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:17
And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain: for you are yet in your sins.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:18
Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:19
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:20
But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:21
For by a man came death: and by a man the resurrection of the dead.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:22
And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:23
But every one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ: then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:24
Afterwards the end: when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father: when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:25
For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:26
And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:27
All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:28
And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  The Son also himself shall be subject unto him.... That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:29
Otherwise, what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then baptized for them?  That are baptized for the dead.... Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:30
Why also are we in danger every hour?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:31
I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:32
If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.  Let us eat and drink, etc.... That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:33
Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:34
Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak it to your shame.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:35
But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? Or with what manner of body shall they come?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:36
Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:37
And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be: but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:38
But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:39
All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:40
And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:41
One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:42
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption: it shall rise in incorruption.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:43
It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness: it shall rise in power.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:44
It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:45
The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:46
Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:47
The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:48
Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:49
Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:50
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:51
Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:52
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible. And we shall be changed.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:53
For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:54
And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:55
O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:56
Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:57
But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 15:58
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.   

## 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:Introduction
Of collection of alms. Admonitions and salutations.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:1
Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints: as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:2
On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him: that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:3
And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:4
And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:5
Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:6
And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:7
For I will not see you now by the way: for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:8
But I will tarry at Ephesus, until Pentecost.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:9
For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:10
Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:11
Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct ye him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I look for him with the brethren.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:12
And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:13
Watch ye: stand fast in the faith: do manfully and be strengthened.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:14
Let all your things be done in charity.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:15
And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:16
That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:17
And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:18
For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:19
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:20
All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:21
The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:22
If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha.  Let him be anathema, maranatha.... Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, ‘The Lord is come’ already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha: ‘May our Lord come’, that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:23
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  

### 1 Corinthians Chapter 16:24
My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
