:description: Introduction and publishing information for the Douay-Rheims Bible

The first version of this Douay-Rheims Bible was one of the first mass-published in English and was a precursor of the King James version. It was written by members of the Counter-Reformation, that were living in exile in France. Later versions of this Bible borrowed, in turn, from the KJV.
