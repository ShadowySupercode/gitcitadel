Alexandria is a Nostr Knowledge Base (NKB) and a reader for long-form articles. It is produced by the https://gitworkshop.dev/r/naddr1qq9xw6t5vd5hgctyv4kqzrthwden5te0dehhxtnvdakqyg8ayz8w3j8jsduq492j39hysg7vnhrtl4zzqcugj4m3q62qlkf8cypsgqqqw7vsfd6ccp[GitCitadel] development cooperative.

== History of the project

Alexandria was originally named "indextr" and was conceived by https://njump.me/npub1m3xdppkd0njmrqe2ma8a6ys39zvgp5k8u22mev8xsnqp4nh80srqhqa5sf[Liminal] to work as a NKB, in particular for scientific or engineering journals and publications.

It was quickly noticed that the same event types (30040 and 30041) could be used to produce eBooks and any other collection of individual articles/pages, so the GitCitadel team decided to take on the project and adapt it to create the https://habla.news/u/laeserin@getalby.com/1719204947236[Alexandria eReading web app], in order to publish out-of-copyright books, starting with the Bible.

== Web client

=== Elegant Design

As Alexandria is targeted toward those who are trying to focus on longer, more-complex content, the design has been stripped down of any distracting elements or unnecessary details, so that the user can concentrate on the valuable information stored in the documents that they are viewing. Both light-mode and dark-mode are available.

=== Modular articles

The specialty of this client is the ability to display long-form articles, particularly of the modular variety: event kinds 30040 and 30041 from [[nkbip-01]].

Modular articles are often referred to as the *Nostr eBook format*, with 30040 index events containing the metadata and the ordered list of the 30041 zettel events, which contain the Asciidoc-formatted content. Here, you can see how the events are linked together and can then be individually selected.

=== Write articles

Alexandria features an upload facility, for you to transform your well-formatted Asciidoc text to Nostr events and publish them to your preferred relays. Our https://thecitadel.nostr1.com relay is set as the default, to ensure that you have at least one relay that is sure to work.

Simply make sure to structure the article content like so:

[source,asciidoc]
----

= title (mind the space)

== section1

text that you want displayed as content

== section2

more text

----

If you have more information, available, you can include them in the standard Asciidoc header or in a preamble (that will be saved to a tag in the 30040 and displayed above the sections).
Example:

.Form for editing the Asciidoc

Until this feature is completed, you can use the upload facility called https://gitworkshop.dev/r/naddr1qqxx2sn0da442arfd35hg7gpz4mhxue69uhhqatjwpkx2un9d3shjtnrdaksyg8ayz8w3j8jsduq492j39hysg7vnhrtl4zzqcugj4m3q62qlkf8cypsgqqqw7vs555whg[eBookUtility].
