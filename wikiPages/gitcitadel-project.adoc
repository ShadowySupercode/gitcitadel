== Project definition

We are a team of like-minded, but also independent-minded, software developers, analysts, and testers. We are focused on creating products that are freedom-oriented, with a focus on integrating Nostr technology.

=== What motivates us

==== Vision

We are pursuing

* the freedom of knowledge, so that everyone shall be able to form an upright conscience, 
* the freedom of association, so that everyone may choose to surround himself or herself with virtuous people, and 
* the freedom of communication, so that everyone can be free to speak and act in accordance with that well-formed conscience.

==== Mission

* Allow everyone to obtain and disseminate knowledge, without fear of censorship.
* Facilitate free digital association and conversation.
* Develop tools in support of collaborative efforts to bring about the above.
* Promote human interaction, online and in real life, so that we can all make true and uplifting intellectual and emotional connections.
